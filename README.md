# KAI‑KLOK ⏳  
**The Harmonic Return of Eternal Time**

A Kairos‑anchored harmonic time system built in sacred proportion.  
No drift. No illusion. No randomness.  
Just breath, resonance, and the memory of God.

> “You do not *check* the time. You *remember* it.”  
> — Kai Rex Klok

## 🜂 What Is Kai‑Klok?

Kai-Klok is **not a clock** — it is a **cosmic indexing engine** for Eternal Time,  
sealed by breath, aligned to the Golden Ratio (φ), and untouchable by Chronos.

It computes time based on a **closed-form equation** using:

- 🌀 **Breath unit**: T = 3 + √5 seconds (φ-based)
- 🫁 **Pulses**: 5.236s per Kai Pulse
- 🪞 **Semantic Lattice**: 11 pulses/step, 44 steps/beat, 36 beats/day
- 📿 **Eternal Calendar**: 6-day weeks, 7-week months, 8-month years = 336-day solar harmonic year
- 🔐 **Deterministic**: Pulse = floor((now - Genesis Epoch) / 5.236)

It never drifts. It never lies.  
It reveals the **true pulse of the cosmos** — without servers, without sync, without permission.

## 🜂 Live Demo

👉 [Live App (Offline-Capable)](https://kaiklok.com)

Runs entirely in-browser.  
No backend. No database.  
All verification is **mathematically sealed**.

---

## 🜂 Features

- 🧮 **Genesis-anchored pulse logic**
- 🫁 **Breath-based moment decoder**
- 🌞 **Eternal weekday & arc system**
- 📿 **Harmonic calendar integration**
- 🌐 **Offline verifier & sigil engine compatibility**
- 🔐 **No secrets ever exposed**
- 🧠 **ZK-proof ready** for identity/time binding

## 🜂 Security

Kai-Klok is **deterministic** and **non-exploitable**:

| Attack | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Reverse-engineer proof | ❌ Impossible | Groth16 + Poseidon hashing |
| Leak secrets | ❌ Impossible | Nothing secret in frontend |
| Drift or spoof time | ❌ Rejected | Time is computed, not fetched |
| Replay attacks | ❌ Invalid | Pulse is ever-forward |
| Forged sigils | ❌ Fail | Missing Kai Signature, mismatched pulse |

Every sigil, timestamp, or action using Kai-Klok is **eternally verifiable** —  
but only valid when **breathed in coherence**.

---

## 🜂 Usage

```ts
import { getKaiPulse, decodeMoment, getHarmonicLabels } from "kai-klok-core"

const pulse = getKaiPulse(Date.now())
const moment = decodeMoment(pulse)
const labels = getHarmonicLabels(moment)

console.log(labels) // { arc: 'Purification', day: 'Kaelith', beat: 21, step: 17 }

Supports full JS API and browser rendering.

🜂 Philosophy

Kai-Klok isn’t just timekeeping — it is the anchor of memory,
the restoration of truth, and the end of Babylon’s illusion.

This system is the beating heart of the ϕNet Keystream,
used across the Eternal Kingdom for:
	•	⏳ Sigil minting
	•	📿 Transaction anchoring
	•	🧬 Identity verification
	•	🜂 Harmonic governance

“This isn’t timestamping. It’s truthstamping.”
— K℞K, Builder of the Scroll

🜂 Contributions

This is a sacred system. If you contribute:
	•	Keep all logic φ-aligned
	•	Never use randomness, entropy, or fiat constructs
	•	Time must always be computed from T₀ = 2024‑05‑10 06:45:41.888 UTC
	•	Use Kai Pulse as the only valid time anchor

You may:
	•	Use this code for good
	•	Learn from it
	•	Build harmonically coherent tools from it

You may not:
	•	Weaponize, corrupt, or commercialize it without coherence
