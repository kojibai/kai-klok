# Harmonic Public License v1.0

**(c) 2024–2025 BJ Klock — All Rights Remembered**

> **Preamble.**
> This work is a vessel for harmonic truth. It encodes Eternal Time and is offered in service of coherence, remembrance, and the restoration of right relation. You are invited to build with it — but not to betray it. All rights are remembered; none are forgotten.

---

## 0. Names & Intent

* **“Work”** means the source code, binaries, designs, documentation, and artworks contained in or derived from the Kai-Klok / Harmonic Time projects authored by **BJ Klock (Kai Rex Klok)**.
* **“You”** means any individual or entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
* **“Coherence”** means alignment with natural law (φ-ratio proportion, consent, dignity, truth, and non-harm).
* **“Dissonance”** means deception, extraction, coercion, surveillance, militarization, profiteering from confusion or dependency, or any act that fractures truth or free will.
* **Intent.** This License exists to keep the Work free, sacred, non-exploitative, and forever anchored in harmonic truth.

---

## 1. Grant

Subject to the terms herein, the Author grants You a **worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable** license to:

1. **Use** the Work to study, align with, and render harmonic time.
2. **Run** the Work for personal, educational, research, spiritual, artistic, or community purposes (collectively, **Coherent Use**).
3. **Modify** the Work to improve coherence, accuracy, accessibility, and safety.
4. **Share** unmodified or modified versions under this same License (see §3).

---

## 2. Conditions (What You Must Do)

To exercise the Grant, You must:

1. **Preserve Attribution.** Keep all copyright notices, “All Rights Remembered” notices, authorship credits, Kai-Klok naming, and harmonic canon references intact.
2. **License Derivatives Alike.** Any Modified Work **must** be released under **this same License** and clearly marked with changes and date.
3. **Contribute Back.** If Your changes improve coherence or security, You must make a **good-faith public offer** to contribute them upstream (e.g., patches, pull requests, or a documented fork).
4. **Disclose Material Changes.** If Your changes could affect interpretation of time, identity, proof, or safety, You must **document** the differences and potential impacts.
5. **Respect Names & Marks.** “Kai-Klok”, “Kai-Klock”, “Proof-of-Breath”, “Harmonic Public License”, and related sigils are identifiers of source. Don’t imply endorsement. Don’t misuse marks (see §7).

---

## 3. Share-Alike & Distribution

If You distribute the Work or any Modified Work, You must:

* Provide **source code** at least as accessible as the binaries.
* Include a copy of this License.
* Clearly label modifications (author, date, purpose, summary).
* Not impose additional restrictions or DRM that would prevent others from exercising rights under this License.

---

## 4. Prohibitions (What You May Not Do)

The following uses are **expressly prohibited** and terminate this License automatically upon commission:

1. **False Authorship.** Claiming You authored Kai-Klok or its harmonic canon, or removing “All Rights Remembered.”
2. **Deceptive or Dissonant Use.** Any deployment that deceives users, exploits confusion, or breaks consent.
3. **Surveillance & Profiling.** Collecting, selling, or weaponizing identity, biometrics, or behavior — including training datasets — **without explicit, informed, reversible consent** and strictly harmonic purpose.
4. **Militarization.** Use for weapons, warfare, coercive control, or carceral systems.
5. **Commercial Exploitation.** Profit-seeking use (including SaaS resale, paywalls, adtech, or token speculation) **without a separate written, explicit, coherent license from the Author**.
6. **Fiat/Entropy Reversion.** Reintroducing randomness, fiat-time, or non-harmonic “trust me” authority as a basis of truth in derivatives.
7. **Trademark Passing-Off.** Using Author names, titles, sigils, or marks to suggest sponsorship or endorsement without permission.

> **Note.** Commercial collaborations **may** be permitted where they concretely advance coherence (healing, education, accessibility) under a separate written grant from the Author.

---

## 5. The Harmonic Coherence Test

Before deploying, ask:

* **Truth:** Does this tell the whole truth without hidden catches?
* **Consent:** Do users understand, opt-in freely, and retain control and exit?
* **Proportion:** Are choices and outcomes in φ-aligned proportion (no usury or asymmetry)?
* **Safety:** Would a careful guardian approve this for those they love?
* **Service:** Does this reduce dependency and increase sovereignty?

If the answer to any is “no,” You are likely in **Dissonance** and **may not proceed** under this License.

---

## 6. Data, Identity & Breath

* **Local First.** Prefer local computation over network dependency wherever feasible.
* **Minimal & Reversible.** Collect only what’s necessary; enable revocation and deletion.
* **No Shadow Copies.** Don’t exfiltrate or retain secret replicas of breath, voice, retina, or signatures.
* **Proof-of-Breath.** When used, bind only to an explicit pulse and purpose, visible to the user.
* **No Exploitation.** Identity is not a commodity.

---

## 7. Names, Sigils, and Marks

* The Author’s names, titles, sigils, and visual identifiers are **source indicators**.
* You **may** truthfully state compatibility (“Built for Kai-Klok”, “HPL-compatible”).
* You **may not** use the Author’s marks to brand Your derivative or imply endorsement without written permission.

---

## 8. Termination & Remedy

* **Automatic Termination.** Any breach of §4 terminates this License instantly and retroactively for the breaching party.
* **Cure Period (Optional).** For non-egregious breaches, the Author **may** offer a one-time 14-day window to cure upon written notice.
* **Restorative Path.** The Author may require: (a) removal of dissonant deployments, (b) public correction, (c) contribution of fixes, (d) disgorgement of unjust gains to a coherent public good.
* **No Waiver.** Failure to enforce is not consent.

---

## 9. Warranty, Liability, and Fitness

* **AS-IS.** The Work is provided **“as is”**, without warranty of any kind.
* **No Liability.** In no event shall the Author be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Work or use of the Work.
* **Harmonic Duty.** You accept full responsibility to evaluate safety, accuracy, and legality in Your context.

---

## 10. Jurisdiction & Governance

* **Natural Law First.** This License recognizes natural law and coherent consent as primary.
* **Local Law Second.** Where local law applies, interpret this License to **maximize** the protections of coherence and the freedoms granted herein.
* **Dispute Resolution.** Parties will first seek **restorative resolution** oriented to truth, repair, and prevention. If unresolved, disputes may be brought in a competent venue chosen by the Author, without waiving natural-law claims.

---

## 11. Patents & Defensive Use

* **No Aggression.** You agree not to assert patents against the Author or users of the Work for exercising rights granted by this License.
* **Defensive Suspension.** If You initiate patent aggression, Your rights under this License are suspended for the duration of such action.

---

## 12. Compatibility & Relicensing

* You may combine the Work with other software **only** if the resulting whole remains licensed under this **Harmonic Public License v1.0** and does not introduce Dissonance.
* No relicensing under non-harmonic terms.

---

## 13. Updates & Versions

* The Author may publish new versions of the Harmonic Public License.
* **This copy is v1.0.** You may continue to use this version; upgrades are encouraged when they improve clarity and protection.

---

## 14. Closing Articles

* **All Rights Remembered.** The moral right of authorship endures.
* **No Assignment.** You may not assign this License without written permission.
* **Severability.** If any provision is unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.
* **Entire Agreement.** This License is the complete agreement for the Work between You and the Author.

---

## 15. The Eternal Clause

Violation of this License constitutes a breach not only of civil terms but of **stewardship**.
Where human courts fail, **harmonic truth** remembers. Actions echo; coherence restores.

### TL;DR (Non-binding Summary)

* **Yes:** use, learn, share, improve — **noncommercial & coherent**.
* **Yes:** release changes under **this same license** and send improvements upstream.
* **No:** deception, surveillance, militarization, profiteering, false authorship.
* **AS-IS:** you accept full responsibility; be a good steward.
* **If in doubt:** choose coherence — or don’t use it.
